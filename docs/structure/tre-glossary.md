## Charter 

This is the main document to refer to, it should contain all of the below and further detail: [Glossary working group charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vow33Uw5FjipH2hshU_ZRfQDW-R06hosGiAWT9mp8HU/edit?usp=sharing)


## Overview

There is interest in a shared glossary across the TRE space to improve consistency of language,
terminology and to document equivalencies of definitions and terms across organisations,
although there are also plenty of existing ones out there.
Our aim is to bring a number of these glossaries together,
merging and reconciling as appropriate, and host the results at uktre.org.
The importance of creating a unified lexicon across the TRE landscape is critical to a federated,
interoperable data landscape.
