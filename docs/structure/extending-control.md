## Overview

The Extending Control Working group is focused on documenting and outlining possible ways in which data can be ‘shared’ across organisations - when it is not one organisation providing all parts (i.e. the data and trusted research environment).
With modern IT in the cloud,
with many new tools and architectures becoming mainstream,
allows new options for datasets within a Secure Data Environment in the Data Zone to be made available to researchers working in the Research Zone within Trusted Research Environment facilities. 

This Working Groups was set up to support delivery of these overall macro concerns and objectives.

- To minimise Time-to-research and delay
- To make combining datasets easy and reduce barriers to research project scope
- To include Citizen’s agency into the “TRE landscape” and Information Governance.
