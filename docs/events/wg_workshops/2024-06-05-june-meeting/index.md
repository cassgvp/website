## Background

​The UK TRE Community is a community of over 200 people that has grown organically over the last year for anyone interested in TREs, including researchers, operators, information governors, managers and more, from all sectors and disciplines.

​The core aims of fostering collaboration and sharing of innovative ideas to support the delivery of groundbreaking research with sensitive data have resonated across the UK and beyond.

​The community has a website, an active mailing list and Slack channel, and runs quarterly events like this for the community to come together, discuss ideas and problems within the TRE space and work collaboratively together on possible solutions and ways forward!

### Keynote

A talk by Pete Barnsley about the Crick's Institute TRE, its current approach and the history of how it came to be.

### Community updates

_A chance for anyone in the community to share quick updates with everyone on the call._

The Community Management Working Group will share progress and general updates and next steps.
Working groups leads will then update the community on their progress and present their charters

This update will mark the start of the official community review period, after which working groups will be formally approved.

### Breakout sessions

Breakout rooms were a mixture of workshops (more structured sessions designed around a particular problem area, focused on moving towards an output) and discussions (less structured sessions to explore general areas of interest within the UK TRE space), as well as open rooms to have general discussions.

There will be two sessions on the day of 45 minutes each.

#### Session 2
