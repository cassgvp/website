# Working Group: Funding and Sustainability

Chair: Lisa Scerri

## Notes

- The aim of the working group today was to finalise the finance survey that will be shortly sent out to UK TRE Community members.
- There was a discussion regarding question 16 What (services) do you charge for? And the inclusion of the option "The Data" which was felt, by an NHS member, to be inappropriate and possibly upsetting for patients. It was decided to add a caveat so that this option is for non-NHS only.
- A member suggested that we add feasibility checks as an option as his organisation will charge, up front, for feasibility checks that require a significant amount of effort, such as the use of NLP. It was agreed to add this.
- Another member suggested that we add "governance processes" as an option due to the length of time and effort that data access processes can cause for the TRE provider. It was agreed to add an operational/governance processes option.
- The survey was signed off and will be sent out June 7th.
- The date of the next meeting was not discussed but will depend on the response rate.
- The Chair will contact the group to for help with the analysis once data collection is complete.
