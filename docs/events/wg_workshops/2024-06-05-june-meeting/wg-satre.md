## Notes

UK TRE WG: https://www.uktre.org/en/latest/structure/satre.html

Charter for review: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ugd32Ki0ssZu42AWWoChE-Tb_sKggM3sfs-4ZzcYoBk/

- Meeting cadence: how often, and how long each time?
- Who else wants to co-chair?
- Who wants to be a named participant?

What should the WG aim to do?

Governance of this working group

- Should co-chairs be elected?
- Be ready for when funding arrives
  - May open up parent institutional funding

Participants:

- Don't have to do loads of work on SATRE, can also be about promoting or acting as a go-between

Activities:

- Gap between statements and guidance... coming back to more technical guidance
  - How can we make it easier to translate SATRE into a real TRE?
- Make more "human" to people, so it can be used as advice, e.g. saying "how" something was done, not just that it was done
- Use SATRE to support delivery of actual TREs
- What level though?
- Reference implementations of SATRE
- Effort required to gain formal accreditation. ISO? Who can contribute?
  - Given that ISO is an internationally recognised standards body, gaining recognition as an ISO standard (https://www.iso.org/about) might be worth exploring to gain widespread SATRE accreditation. This is their front door to developing standards: https://www.iso.org/developing-standards.html
  - NHSE accreditation process, oriented at sub-national.
  - Submit a paper before applying to show impact it's had
- Evaluation of initial specification, mature in some areas

Is a cloud agnostic TRE possible?
