# Data processing tools

Workshop

**Leads**: James Friel (University of Dundee), Aida Sanchez (UCL)

## Proposal

### Prompts

- Risk appetite to deposit data in a TRE -  What level on de-identification is comfortable for use within a TRE? e.g truncation, pseudo-anonymization
- What do current data processing pipelines look like? And are their pain points in the process?
- What De-identification tools are being used? What has worked? What hasn't?


### Summary

Intro discussion around data processing, de-identification , and cohort building. 

### Preparation

A general understanding of data anonymisation.
The ICO anonymisation guidance & the ADF (anonymisation decision making framework) may be of interest as a grounding in this.


### Target audience

People who work in data de-identification and data providers for TRES
