# Workshop: Researcher Registry Project

**Leads**: Emily Jefferson (HDR UK), Rachel Tesfaye, Senior Technical Programme Manager, HDR UK

- Presentation slides can be found [here](https://hdruk.box.com/s/jyyhabcwrks9b6vk7osd4uqwn1opou5y).

## Session Details

The Researcher Registry is one of four [cloud pilot projects](https://www.ukri.org/news/pilot-projects-will-aid-better-and-safer-use-of-data-in-research/) funded by UKRI with the aim of aiding better and safer use of data in research. The project is a partnership initiative working towards an integrated ‘Know Your Researcher’ system, aligned with the ‘Five Safes’ Safe People principle, surfacing historical and current information about a researcher requesting access to a TRE.

The aims of this project workshop are as follows:

- **Project introduction**: high-level project overview, technical developments (blockchain technology implementation, rules engine development, Identity Document Validation Technology)
- **Researcher and Organisation Registry data flow:** explore key components of the ‘Know Your Researcher’ system
- **Open discussion:** key questions to ensure the capability of the Researcher Registry tool meets the needs of the UK TRE Community and adds value by streamlining existing researcher verification processes (see prompts below)
- **Summary and next steps:** summary of key outputs and actions from the session alongside next steps related to upcoming development and operational milestones

### Required preparation

Project brief can be accessed [here](https://hdruk.box.com/s/spjh7o8cgr7arejvzna6dg386ndkuv2a) which outlines the project background, goals, scope, timelines, stakeholders, current common model, and high-level data flow.

### Target audience

All UK TRE Community members are welcome to attend this session including Community members with an interest or expertise in the Five Safes framework, particularly Safe People.

### Prompts

- What are the key considerations or concerns surrounding the researcher workflow?
- What are the key considerations or concerns surrounding the organisational workflow?
- What are the key considerations or concerns surrounding manual vs automated researcher verification processes? e.g.: up-to date project information, up-to-date training information etc.
- What other systems (upstream or downstream) may be impacted by the implementation of this tool?

## Notes

Open discussion on key questions to ensure the capabilities of the project serves the community.

### Researcher workflow

- Account for multiple organisations/institutional link to individual researcher.
- Given the nature of researchers often wearing multiple hats across different organisations/affiliations, the Registry will have the functionality for users to have a primary/lead organisation alongside adding additional affiliations.
- Delegate sponsorship will also be available for an extra degree of verification via [Identity Document Validation Technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-document-validation-technology/identification-document-validation-technology) (IDVT).

### Manual vs automated processes

- The researcher registry will have a rules engine capability enabling Issuers (TREs/SDEs) to write automated decision models
- Not weight limiting for OPC use case – doesn’t need to be automated, no issue with current manual checks
- What benefit is it yielding, potential delays to access in data? Security systems/enable quicker access to data for frequent fliers – thresholds for quicker approvals.
- Depending on TRE, take time for administration staff to do checks, potential efficiency benefit. Other benefit – most organisations have responsibility for employees in terms of access to sensitive data (including good/bad behaviour), but they don’t have an idea of who is currently accessing data and where and proper process. Or level for DPO of organisation to see all researchers and which projects they are on. Other benefit – One TRE able to see which TREs researchers have worked on. Better way of community of TREs.

### User testing

- Early testing of prototype and MVP is a priority
- We will be testing with NHS SDE Network exemplar pilots over the summer as early adoptors / examplar pilots. We will also test the prototype with UK TRE Community in autumn and test the MVP in winter.
- Also working with SAIL as a delivery partner

## Next steps

- Communicate information around IG and Policy Working Group to interested UK TRE Community members.
- Communicate information around prototype stakeholder reviews and testing to interested UK TRE Community members.
- Potentially host follow-up session at September UK TRE Community meeting.
