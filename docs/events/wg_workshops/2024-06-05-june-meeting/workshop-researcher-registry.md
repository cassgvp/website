# Researcher Registry Project

**Leads**: Emily Jefferson (HDR UK)

## Proposal

### Summary

Researcher Registry Project

HDR is developing a UK-wide standard for a "Safe Person" and also a technical solution to support TREs to be able to see information on Researchers and their organisations to help them make decisions on whether or not a Researcher is "safe".
The registry would also keep a record of which projects researchers have been approved to work on across TREs.

HDR UK would like input into the current design from the community to ensure that it meets needs.

### Preparation

No required preparation beyond an open mind!
