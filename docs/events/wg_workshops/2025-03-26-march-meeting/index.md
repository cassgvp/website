## About the event: Information Governance

​As part of the sequence of events focused on understanding "federation" and its implications on the UK TRE community, this event is all about Information Governance.

​We are teaming up with the UKTRE DARE UK interest group on Information Governance that has just started and is funded till March 2026. See here to join that JISC email channel: TRE-IG@jiscmail.ac.uk

​​We will get started with our usual community updates, both from working groups and anyone that wants to share out (please let us know in advance if you would like to speak).
