# SATRE

## Notes

- SATRE and AzureTRE
- SHAIP (Safe Haven AI Platform, Canon R&D) SATRE assessment
  - TRE within Scotland safe haven network
  - Different scoring system to indicate whether SHAIP:
    - enables a requirement as a core part
    - supports a requirement as part of the overall TRE
    - requires a TRE to support for SHAIP
    - doesn't meet, possible gap
    - not required for SHAIP solution
  - Few missing requirements
  - Haven't found anything wrong in SATRE
  - Scottish DSH: found possible gaps on specialisms of capability
  - 33 N/A for SHAIP as a vendor inside a TRE
  - 21 Optional not relevant, 12 mandatories not relevant
  - 4 requirements as possible gaps in SHAIP. 3 optional one mandatory (on-prem encryption can be prohibitively expensive for very large datasets)
  - 32 requirements that SHAIP expects the TRE to provide (10 optional/recommended, 22 mandatory)
  - 12 requirements that SHAIP supports a TRE in implementing
  - Some capabilities can be summarised as "follow state of the art risk management", could be worth highlighting TRE specific capabilities?
  - Additional private score on how well something is implemented
  - Excel pivot table for different views, e.g. capabilities that must be implement, those where SHAIP must support TRE to implement, groups by pillar, etc
- Can we change the SATRE scoring system to this?
- Scoring is kind-of reverse of capability maturity model
- CMRE role: role of someone in inplmenting
- Can scoring system/roles be made public, for consideration as a replacement scoring system in SATRE
- Some areas where it's impossible for a solution provider to implement on it's own
- Can we split capabilities by domain e.g. technology provider, vs people, etc? Then different roles/providers can take care of evaluating different areas.
  - Would e.g. allow AzureTRE (product, not a deployment) to be evaluated against relevant part of SATRE. What's a feature, what's an SOP
- ISO mapping, so ISO27001 accredited TREs _automatically_ tick relevant SATRE requirements

- AzureTRE: initial evaluation

- First impressions on using SATRE:
  - Getting started, 160 requirements, too many to evaluate before dinner
  - Smaller would be more accessible (e.g. best practice could be condensed into a single box)
  - SATRE very inclusive
  - Different mindsets, e.g. "data must not be shared between projects", but what about multiple related projects where data should be shared amongst limited projects?
  - But gap for federated
