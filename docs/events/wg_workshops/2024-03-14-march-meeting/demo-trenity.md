## Session

### Summary

Trenity aims to standardize the construction, deployment, and management of Trusted Research Environments (TREs), driven by principles like SATRE (achieving 70% SATRE compliance from the outset) and the Five Safes framework. The product suite includes Trenity Secure and Trenity Edge among others, all managed through a unified dashboard facilitating Information Governance (IG) actions such as data ingress and egress, customizable descriptive data models, and comprehensive views of assets (datasets) and projects. Project dashboards provide members with various tools including task management, discussions, and literature review, with a distinct results tab that integrates the approval process for data release through a multi-role approval process (PI -> reviewer -> final release by TRE) for data egress. Trenity plans to adopt a service-based business model, offering the "base" software for free with a service-based business model on top.

### Raw notes

- [Trenity](https://trenity.co.uk/) demo
- Aim is to harmonise the building, deployment & management of TREs
- Big drivers for Trenity include
  - SATRE, Five Safes
- Aim is a 1-tool solution for deploying & managing a TRE
  - 70% SATRE compliance on day 1
- Four products
  - Trenity Secure
  - 2
  - 3
  - Trenity Edge
- Single management dashboard for IG actions like ingress/egress
  - What's the descriptive data model behind the scenes?
    - Can define and customise your own
  - Views of assets (datasets), projects, etc.
- Project dashboard visible to project members
  - tabs for task views, discussions, literature, more
  - results tab allows PI approval for release, then creating "outbound request"
    - this hands off to an approval process
  - Three roles involved: PI (to release from project); reviewer (IG review); release authority (final release from TRE)
    - "release" pushes approved files to Internet-facing part of the TRE
    - still requires log-in to access
- Plan is to release "base" Trenity software for free, with service-based business model on top
- Currently Azure-based
  - auto-deployment of TRE would be a premium/freemium feature
  - pretty cloud-agnostic underneath
