# Working Group: Funding & Sustainability

## Notes

- Various strands to TREs: data partner - technology / infrastructure side - data curation itself, information governance
- Sustaining the future of the 'TRE' workforce itself - career progressions/frameworks/training
  - Very specialised work
  - Any staff churn is very damaging to hive knowledge/capability
  - Hard to recruit and retain
- Cohesion at UKRI (really across councils) level is really needed
- Using RSE Con as an example: came about to (1) reduce the brain drain in the RSE space and (2)
- How does funding work today?
  - So many models today and horrible to work with.
  - What could it look like?
  - Define challenge and difficulty
  - Health, admin, etc. all fund/operate in different ways
- 80% FEC is difficult for non-academic roles
- What is the role of TREs in teaching new methods/techiques?
- How do we bring information governance knowledge up to date with software/infra/data techniques in order to provide appropriate audit? (training challenge)
- Roadmap between current state and goal.
  - Who is funding different challenges?
  - How are these coordinated?
  - Articulate risks and issues
- What is the direction of the community?
  - Should it be it's own society?
  - Should it be part of RSE soc?
  - How do we represent very different skills without needing to join _yet another org_
