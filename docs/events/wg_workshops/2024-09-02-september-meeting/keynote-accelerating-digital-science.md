# Federation: Accelerating digital science panel

## Notes

### Question: what is federation?

Membership which comes with benefits and obligations.
May end up with a de facto standard being pushed by the largest player.
The rulebook for how a community can work together.

### Question: How do you reconcile the requirements of individual data controllers in order to federate, beyond asking nicely?

Distinguish between the data provider and the data controller. Most TREs likely to be hosted on someone else's infrastructure, but the control can be more granular.
Facilitate the conversation with the individual who's data it is - give control to the citizen - but consider how that may affect bias/coverage/representation.
Consider advocating for changes in primary legislation on control of data.
Controllers are cautious - be transparent about disclosure risk. Can't currently demonstrate to the controller how risky their data is - providing more transparent empirical information can demonstrate the risk involved.

### Question: Do Research Councils have a role to play and what would that look like for you?

EU Commission are not shy to say "you need to standardise" so the people advising the Councils are not pushing it.

Doesn't have to be a Research Council employee. Telecomms industry emerged as community driven standards, UKRI have to recognise the value and put in place the policies to drive value longer term. We do not need another rider on all grants of "comply with this".

Consider a Standards Commission with teeth - ability to disincentivise if people do not comply. Need a compelling use case - the "killer app" - what could that be in this case? Suggest need more stick.

DARE Phase 2 teaser for later talk...

### Question: If we put everything into a smaller number of TREs, how do we avoid single points of value?

Don't put everything in one TRE - incredibly hard to get all the different custodians to agree to that - work to federate in such a way that it's streamlined rather than amalgamating.
Domain specialisms make sense for different, fewer TREs - e.g. health and social science rather than health and particle physics. Important to map and understand what those domains are.

Would never work for trans-national communities.

### Question: What role can the public play in federation?

Giving people control on which studies they are involved in, rather than yes to research or not. Need to move beyond asking "are you happy for your data to be used in research?" to "what do we need to do to accommodate your concerns?". Should be a constant conversation.

Not necessarily practical to ask at every level of granularity - e.g. every project level would be extremely difficult.
The level of granularity is a really interesting point - for providing future-proofed platforms, we need to engage with younger audiences as they are hugely underrepresented in PPIE and their opinion matters

### What about a _data donor_ similar to the organ donor initiative?
