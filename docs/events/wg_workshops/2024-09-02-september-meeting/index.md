# UK TRE Annual Conference - September 2024

## Accelerating secure digital science through community collaboration

:Date: [Monday 2nd September 2024](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2024-09-02/09:30/UK%20TRE%20Community%20meeting)
:Time: 09:30 - 17:00
:Registration: https://lu.ma/icjl9wmb
:Location: In person at [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/venue/) and online

## Background

Trusted research environments and datasets are fundamental to digital science, but work is often delayed due to the time and effort required to set up a secure project, get access to the right approved data, and to sign legal agreements.

There is enormous value locked up because of this: new research ideas are blocked by the hurdles of getting started and accessing data, and typical fixed term project funding means significant research time is lost.

We want to discuss what is stopping us from fixing these three critical issues: getting data federated to approved projects; instant provisioning of infrastructure for collaborative projects; and streamlining legal discussions with standard accepted T&Cs and operating models.

The UK TRE community has already setup several working groups to look at some of these problems, and we plan to submit a [UKRI Digital Research Technical Professional Skills NetworkPlus](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-digital-research-technical-professional-skills-networkplus/) grant to create a long-term footing for the UK TRE community, and to support the community in joining or creating working groups to solve the critical issues which are hampering secure digital research.

### Keynote panel

This year we will follow a panel format with invited speakers discussing their experience in the practicalities of federating TREs and bridging communities.
There will be plently of time for questions and discussions to arise.

Speakers will be confirmed soon.

### Community updates

Hear about everything that has happened in the community for the past year and next steps.
These include our intention to submit a [UKRI Digital Research Technical Professional Skills NetworkPlus](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-digital-research-technical-professional-skills-networkplus/) grant, so during this time we will unpack our plans so you can contribute and support it.

All other working groups will also share updates and how they are contributing to our common challenges:

- SATRE: An accreditation and specification for generic SDE/TRE facilities is needed. How these adapt to cover the different parts of a digital science platform remains a central need, helping the federation of datasets to projects.

- SDE/TRE terminology & the TRE Glossary: Developing the community language for the digital science platform will make sure the parts join up and projects can be provisioned.

- Extending Control: How the technology works with and enables information governance. So helping the federation of datasets to projects.

- Cybersecurity risk: A base capability for any digital science platform, and how these risks change with new approaches and tools (e.g. AI/ML) is an ever emerging factor.

- Citizen Agency: Digital science is all about collaboration with people. Failure will result unless it is ensured that they remain connected to the platform and support science that is consent based as well as population.

### Breakout sessions

As usual there will be plenty of time dedicated to community discussions and we will break into groups for them.

For the first session we will pose key questions about the direction of the community for everyone to discuss over coffee,
collaboratively setting our goals to ensure this is the community you want.

For our second session you can join any of the working groups and discuss with them their progress (it's okay if you are not already part of it, or unsure about joining it afterwards).
But we will also hold community lead discussions on the topics YOU PROPOSE!
Make sure to complete the form you received after registering, and if you haven't please do (get in touch at hello@uktre.org if you can't find it)
