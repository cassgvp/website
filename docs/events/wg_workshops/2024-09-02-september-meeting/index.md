:Time: 09:30 - 17:00

:Location: In person at [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/venue/) and online

## Background

Trusted research environments and datasets are fundamental to digital science, but work is often delayed due to the time and effort required to set up a secure project, get access to the right approved data, and to sign legal agreements.

There is enormous value locked up because of this: new research ideas are blocked by the hurdles of getting started and accessing data, and typical fixed term project funding means significant research time is lost.

We want to discuss what is stopping us from fixing these three critical issues: getting data federated to approved projects; instant provisioning of infrastructure for collaborative projects; and streamlining legal discussions with standard accepted T&Cs and operating models.

The UK TRE community has already setup several working groups to look at some of these problems, and we plan to to submit a [UKRI Digital Research Technical Professional Skills NetworkPlus](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-digital-research-technical-professional-skills-networkplus/) grant to create a long-term footing for the UK TRE community, and to support the community in joining or creating working groups to solve the critical issues which are hampering secure digital research.
